# Hi there, I'm Patrick Wiloak 👋

## About Me

Tech professional with extensive experience across the industry. I led the Market Research team at a startup specializing in IPv4 brokerage (2017), where my research played a critical role in addressing IPv4 exhaustion challenges. This work contributed to securing a GSA contract with the Department of Defense, providing valuable insights into large-scale infrastructure and network resource management.

My career has been shaped by solving complex technical challenges and bridging the gap between research, business strategy, and implementation.
