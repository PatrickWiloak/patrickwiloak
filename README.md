## About Me

Tech professional with a diverse career path spanning multiple industries. My journey into tech began after years in hospitality (waiter, bartender), which taught me invaluable lessons about customer service, communication, and working under pressure.

In tech, I've worn many hats - from Sales Development Representative to Business Analyst, and notably as Market Research Team Lead at an IPv4 brokerage startup (2017). There, my research played a critical role in addressing IPv4 exhaustion challenges and contributed to securing a GSA contract with the Department of Defense.

My varied background has shaped my ability to solve complex technical challenges while bridging the gap between research, business strategy, and implementation.
