## About Me

Solutions Architect and AI/ML specialist with 3.5 years at Amazon Web Services, where I drove millions in revenue through GenAI enablement and cloud modernization. Awarded Quarterly All-Star Award (top ~1% of field) for customer obsession in Q1 2024.

My path to tech wasn't traditional - I worked as a substitute teacher, UPS package handler, and at a bowling alley/bar before breaking into technology. That grind taught me work ethic, persistence, and how to communicate with all types of people. Since entering tech, I've specialized in helping federal partners and Fortune 100 customers architect scalable cloud solutions, with particular expertise in AI/ML, GenAI (Amazon Bedrock, SageMaker), and cloud migration.

From building RAG PoCs and driving multiple GenAI Competencies in <90 days, to leading market research that contributed to a $500B+ IPv4 transfer market and led to a GSA with DoD, my varied background has shaped my ability to solve complex technical challenges while bridging the gap between cutting-edge technology and business outcomes.

## Education

**George Mason University** | May 2018
Bachelor of Science - Information Systems and Operations Management (ISOM)

*Coursework:* Databases · Networking · Algorithm Development · Computer Science · Supply Chain · Forecasting · Project and Program Management · Software Development Lifecycle · Accounting · Business Law

GMU is often called "the commuter school" because most folks have jobs - students and faculty alike. Many professors are adjuncts with real-world experience, not the traditional academic types. That practical, hands-on approach set my foundation, but my real education came from grinding it out in the field, getting certifications, and learning on the job.

### Competitive Gamer 🎮
- **Formerly ranked #47 in Halo FFA** - Achieved top 50 global ranking in Free-For-All competitive play
- **Level 50 in Halo 2 and Halo 3**
- **Halo 1** - Grew up playing online with Xbox Connect (tunneling software that tricked the Xbox into thinking you were on a LAN) before Xbox Live existed

*The same discipline and persistence that drives me through 26.2 miles and competitive gaming fuels my approach to solving complex technical challenges.*
